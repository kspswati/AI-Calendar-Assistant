# AI-Calendar-Assistant
This project builds an AI-powered calendar assistant that lets you add events simply by sending text instructions. Using n8n, OpenAI’s Chat Model, and Google Calendar integration, the workflow understands natural language commands, interprets dates and times, and automatically schedules events—saving you time and streamlining calendar management.
